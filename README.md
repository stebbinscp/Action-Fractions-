# Action-Fractions
Object oriented fraction class with emphasis on overloading built in python methods. Implements a fraction operation module to test your ability to do math with fractions. Mine definitely needs improvement

Fraction Class
The fraction class initializes with a numerator and denominator, providing the following methods.
1. as_decimal: This method turns a fraction ina decimal rounded to three decimal points.
2. __str__: turns the fraction into a string for representation
3. __add__: overloads the addition function to add two fractions together
4. __sub__: overloads the subtraction method to subtract two fractions
5. __mul__: overloads the multiplication method to multiply two fractions
6. __truediv__: overloads the division function to divide one function by another

Fraction Tester
The pytest runs attestations to see if the methods of the class return the expected outcome.

Action Fractions
Action Fractions develops random operators and fractions so you can feel like you can't do math and never should have passed elementary school.
